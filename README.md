# mock-chain
Easily mock and test chained api calls, powered by Proxy

Testing whether a function has made correctly chained api calls with correct arguments can be difficult. Also, mocking an external api you don't own can be tedious and brittle. Use `mock-check` to record and compare chained api calls & property access in your tests!
